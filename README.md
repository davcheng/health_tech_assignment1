## Introduction

The ResearchKit (Apple) and ResearchStack (Android) software frameworks allow researchers in the medical field to create and build apps that allow them to reach a large amount of users. Both systems utilize Active Tasks that allow researchers test usersâ€™ abilities across a wide variety of abilities. The Ohmage-omh is an open mobile data collection platform built specifically with educational and medical research surveys in mind. 

Using an app based on these frameworks and Ohmage, you will be using the ImpulsivityOhmage app to collect impulsivity data on yourself.

Impulsiveness is described as a behavior that is characterized by the presence of self control (or lack thereof).  

## Objectives
Create a visual representation of your own personally collected data from the ResearchKit/Stack ImpulsivityOhmage app.
